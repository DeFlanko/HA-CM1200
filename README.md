# Netgear CM1200 MQTT Modem Scraper for Home Assistant

This project lets you monitor your Netgear CM1200 cable modem in Home Assistant by scraping its status page using Playwright, then publishing results to your MQTT broker for easy integration.

---

## Features

- Scrapes all channel stats, SNR, power levels, frequencies, OFDM, OFDMA, and system uptime from your modem.
- Publishes each channel/value as a separate MQTT topic.
- Simple Python scriptâ€”runs externally (PC, Raspberry Pi, server, etc).
- Hassle-free Home Assistant OS/Container compatibility.
- Provides a ready-to-use `configuration.yaml` for all channels and status fields.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- You have a working MQTT broker (like Mosquitto) accessible to Home Assistant.
- You can run Python scripts on a system with internet/LAN access to your modem.

### 2. Set Up the Scraper

#### a. Clone or download this repo.

#### b. Install requirements:
```sh
pip install playwright paho-mqtt
playwright install chromium
```

#### c. Edit `cm1200_mqtt_scraper.py`:
- Set your MQTT and modem details at the top of the script.

#### d. Run the script:
```sh
python3 cm1200_mqtt_scraper.py
```

### 3. Add Sensors to Home Assistant

**Copy the contents of [full_home_assistant_sensors.yaml](full_home_assistant_sensors.yaml) into your `configuration.yaml` or an `!include` file.**

This configuration creates a sensor for each downstream and upstream channel, OFDM/OFDMA channels, and all summary/status fields as shown on the CM1200 modem status page.  
*If your modem has a different number of channels, adjust the numbers accordingly.*

## Example MQTT Topics

- `homeassistant/cm1200/ds_power/channel_1`
- `homeassistant/cm1200/ds_snr/channel_1`
- `homeassistant/cm1200/us_power/channel_1`
- `homeassistant/cm1200/ofdm_power/channel_1`
- `homeassistant/cm1200/ofdma_power/channel_1`
- `homeassistant/cm1200/system_uptime`
- `homeassistant/cm1200/all` (full JSON blob)

## Why External?

Home Assistant OS does not allow installing custom Python packages or browsers.  
This script runs anywhere you like and integrates perfectly via MQTT!
